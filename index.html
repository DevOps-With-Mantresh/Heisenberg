            “I have spent my whole life scared, frightened of things that could
            happen, might happen, might not happen, 50-years I spent like that.
            Finding myself awake at three in the morning. But you know what?
            Ever since my diagnosis, I sleep just fine. What I came to realise
            is that fear, that’s the worst of it. That’s the real enemy. So, get
            up, get out in the real world and you kick that bastard as hard you
            can right in the teeth.”
